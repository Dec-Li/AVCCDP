This repository contains the instances used in our paper "Meals on Autonomous Wheels: Delivery with Vehicle-Customer Coordination".

With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, autonomous meal delivery has emerged as a promising solution for efficient urban logistics. This paper studies the Autonomous Vehicle-Customer Coordination Delivery Problem (AVCCDP). Specifically, we introduce a vehicle-customer coordination mechanism in which autonomous vehicles serve as mobile lockers (secure, temporary pickup points). This mechanism enables flexible parking and guided customer movement to improve delivery efficiency while maintaining user convenience. Given the time-sensitive nature of meal delivery and the need to encourage customer movement, it is essential to jointly optimize delivery routes and customer movements. We formalize this challenge as a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem. Furthermore, the AVCCDP provides a generalized framework that is applicable to both the order batching policy (OBP) and the order postponement policy (OPP).

The instance folder contains all data instances used in this research, which are divided into two main categories: offline instances and online instances.
